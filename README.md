This is my minecraft clock project
I built a 8x8 wood cube, added custom time keeping/displaying electronics,
an arduino to control everything, and a rouge robotics uMp3 board to play the minecraft music
On alarm it plays a random minecraft song, just like in game.

uses:
	DS1307
	16x2 parallel LCD
	uMp3 board
	2 LEDs
	4 momentary buttons
